This is a virtual tree for MiuiCamera on my builds of custom ROMs for Xiaomi Mi 6.
It is dependent to vendor/xiaomi/miuicamera which gets created by the extract-files.sh script within this tree. Note that the actual APK has to be from an Android One device to not force close on AOSP ROMs. The other libraries should work from stock ROM, but make sure to edit the pathes in proprietary-files.txt (if needed).
This Module will override the Snap camera.
